/**
 * PLACEHOLDER CAR ICON
 * 
 * Since image generation is unavailable, you need to:
 * 1. Find/create a top-down car icon (PNG, 40x40px recommended)
 * 2. Save it as: mobile-app/assets/car-icon.png
 * 
 * Sources for free icons:
 * - Flaticon.com
 * - Icons8.com
 * - The Noun Project
 * 
 * Search for: "car top view icon" or "vehicle marker icon"
 * 
 * Alternative: The app will work with React Native's default marker
 * if this file is missing, but custom icon is recommended for
 * better visual appearance.
